/*Description

You are given a number, stored in a variable with the namenum

You have to printnumlines, and on each line print all the numbers from 1 to the value stored innum

For example, if the value stored innum = 5, then the required output is

1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5

Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored innum


Output
Print the output as mentioned in the problem statement


Sample Input 1 

4
Sample Output 1

1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored innum = 4

Therefore, we print 4 lines, and on each line we print all the values from[1,4]

Hence, the output will be

1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4*/
function yourFirstNested(num) {
   for(var i=1; i<=num; i++) {

        for(var j=1; j<=num; j++) {
            line+= j + " ";
        }
        console.log(line);
    }
}
