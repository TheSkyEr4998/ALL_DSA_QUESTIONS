Description

Neelam has N friendsstudying in various schools. She wants to find a new friend in(N+1)th school. Assume all schools are separated by 1 unit distance. To reach(N+1)th school she has to board a bus.

The ith school would cost ofC[i]rupees to travel 1 unit of distance. In other words, the bus fare to travel from the ith school to the jth school isabs(i â€“ j ) * C[i]rupees.

The task is to find the minimum bus fare to travel from school 1 to school(N + 1)i.e. beyond the last school.


Input
Input Format

First Line Consists of Single integerN

Second Line Consists ofNintegers separated by spaces.(Cost to travel 1 unit distance from ith school)

Constraints

1 < =N<= 10^6

1 <=C[i]<= 10000


Output
Print the minimum cost to travel.


Sample Input 1 

5
4 7 8 3 4
Sample Output 1

18
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

Board the bus at the first school then change the bus at the fourth school.

(3 * 4) + (2 * 3) = 12 + 6 = 18
