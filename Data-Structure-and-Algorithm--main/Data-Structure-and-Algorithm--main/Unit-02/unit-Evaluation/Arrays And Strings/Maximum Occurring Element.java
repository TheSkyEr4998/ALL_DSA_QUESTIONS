Sample Input 1 

5
0 2 0 6 9
Sample Output 1

0
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

Since 0 is present the maximum number of times (2 times) => The answer is 0*/
 public static void maximumOccuringElement(int N, int[] A){
    //write your code here
       int max = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < N; j++){
            if (A[j] == A[i]){
                count++;}}
        if (count > max){
           max = count; 
           ans = A[i];}}
        System.out.println(ans);
     }
