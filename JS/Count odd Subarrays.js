/*Count odd Subarrays Ended
Description

Given an array A of integers containing N elements.

Output the count of subarrays such that the product of elements in it isodd.


Input
Input Format:

The first line of input will contain an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case will contain an integer N, denoting the size of the array

The next line will contain N integers denoting the array elements, A[0], A[1], A[2].....A[N-1]



Constraints:

1<= T <=10

1<= N <=10^5

1<= A[i] <= 10^5


Output
For each test case, output an integer denoting the count of the subarrays whose product of elements in it is odd


Sample Input 1 

1
3
1 2 3
Sample Output 1

2
Hint

In Sample 1:

T = 1

N = 3

Array: 1, 2, 3

Subarrays whose product is odd : {1} , {3}

So the output is 2 as there are only two sub-arrays whose product of element is odd*/
