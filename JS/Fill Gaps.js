/*Description

You are given a sorted linked list containing unique values. You have to manipulate the linked list such that the difference between every two adjacent node values should be exactly equal to 1. You can only insert some extra between existing nodes in the linked list.

Note

You donâ€™t need to take input/output. Just implement the given function.


Input
The first line of input contains the N denoting the number of elements of the linked list.

The second line contains the elements of the linked list.

Function description

fillGaps(head) {

// Write your code here

}
Arguments:

head = head node of the LinkedList.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^4

1<= node.val <=10^6


Output
Return the head of the modified linked list.

Note

The sample output will contain the modified Linked List.


Sample Input 1 

3
4 7 8
Sample Output 1

4 5 6 7 8
Sample Input 2 

5
2 5 8 9 11
Sample Output 2

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
Hint

Explanation of Sample 1

The given linked list has elements 4 and 7. We can insert nodes 5 and 6 between 4 and 7 to make a new LinkedList having a difference between every pair of adjacent nodes equal to 1. So, the linked list becomes 4->5->6->7.*/

const LinkedListNode = class {
    constructor(nodeData) {
        this.data = nodeData;
        this.next = null;
    }
};
var fillGaps = function (head) {
    let curnt = head;
    if (head.next == null) {
        return head;
    }
    while (curnt.next != null) {
        if (curnt.next.data != curnt.data + 1) {
            let nextNode = curnt.next;
            let myNode = new LinkedListNode(curnt.data + 1);
            curnt.next = myNode
            myNode.next = nextNode
        }
        curnt = curnt.next
    }
    return head;
};
