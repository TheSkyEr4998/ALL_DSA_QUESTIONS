// Deletion of characters to make them nice

// Let's call a string good if its length is even, and every character in odd position of this string is different from the next character (the first character is different from the second, the third is different from the fourth, and so on).

// For example, the strings "good", "string" and "xyyx" are good strings, and the strings "bad", "aa" and "aabc" are not good. Note that the empty string is considered good.

// You are given a string s, you have to delete minimum number of characters from this string so that it becomes good.
