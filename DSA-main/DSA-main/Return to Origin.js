// Visualize a honeycomb maze in the form of a 2d array (n rows, m columns). Refer to the figure to see what a honeycomb maze looks like (but keep in mind that yours is in the form of 2d array)

// You are given a starting point (row, column) where you are present in the maze. your task is to find out whether or not you can traverse the maze and return to the original position. You cannot visit any cell in the maze that has already been visited. Also, you have to make a minimum of 'k' number of moves before returning to the starting point. The '.' represent the empty blocks whereas the '*' represent the blocks that can't be visited .From a block (x,y) you can move only to blocks (x-1,y) , (x+1,y) , (x,y+1) , (x,y-1) . You have to print if it is possible return to your original position.
