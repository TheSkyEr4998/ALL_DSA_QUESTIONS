// Neelam has N friendsstudying in various schools. She wants to find a new friend in(N+1)th school. Assume all schools are separated by 1 unit distance. To reach(N+1)th school she has to board a bus.

// The ith school would cost ofC[i]rupees to travel 1 unit of distance. In other words, the bus fare to travel from the ith school to the jth school isabs(i â€“ j ) * C[i]rupees.

// The task is to find the minimum bus fare to travel from school 1 to school(N + 1)i.e. beyond the last school.
